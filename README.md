## What I do

**Cloud Engineering**
I help teams design, build, and operate scalable platforms – across AWS, Azure, and hybrid environments.

I build and maintain Terraform modules, Helm charts, and DevOps tools I use myself in the field.

## About Me

I'm a dad of two, cloud-native enthusiast, and part-time LEGO engineer. Currently training for my first triathlon and half marathon – pushing limits is part of the fun.

When I'm not in a terminal, you'll find me outdoors running trails, exploring mountains, or recovering with strong coffee and metal playlists.
