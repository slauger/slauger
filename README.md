# Hey there, I'm Simon Lauger

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Consultant & Trainer** focused on Cloud Infrastructure, DevOps, Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, and Knowledge Sharing.

## What I do

**Cloud Engineering**
I help teams design, build, and operate scalable platforms – across AWS, Azure, and hybrid environments.

**AI-Driven Development & Automation**
I integrate AI tools and workflows into development processes – boosting productivity through intelligent automation, code generation, and modern scripting approaches.

**MLOps & Model Operations**
From model development to production deployment – I build CI/CD pipelines for ML workloads, container-based model serving, and monitoring on Kubernetes.

**Containers & Kubernetes**
From first pod to production-grade clusters – I guide teams on their container journey.

**Process Modernization**
I help organizations modernize their workflows through Infrastructure as Code, AI-assisted development, and intelligent automation – delivering massive efficiency gains.

**Trainings & Workshops**
I share knowledge through hands-on workshops, in-depth sessions, and real-world examples.

**Open Source**
I build and maintain Terraform modules, Helm charts, and DevOps tools I use myself in the field.

## About Me

I'm a cloud-native enthusiast currently training for my first triathlon and half marathon – pushing limits is part of the fun.

When I'm not in a terminal, you'll find me outdoors running trails, exploring mountains, or recovering with strong coffee and metal playlists.
