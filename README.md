From first pod to production-grade clusters – I guide teams on their container journey.

## 😄 About Me

I’m a dad of two, cloud-native enthusiast, and part-time LEGO engineer (thanks to my kids). 

Currently training for my **first triathlon** and preparing to run a **half marathon** – because pushing limits is part of the fun. 🏃‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏊

When I’m not in a terminal, you’ll find me outdoors – running trails, exploring mountains, or recovering with strong coffee and metal playlists. ☕
